# Clinical-Data-Related-Projects
Currently working with Dr. Paul Frankel to make simulations for the IQ 3+3 and IQ Rolling 6 trial designs more accessible to those in the space, since the original study used 3rd party software. Ultimate goal is to create something that matches the study data, then port the desired product to R Shiny.
